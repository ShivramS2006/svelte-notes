## How to use
 
 You can use the app either by visiting the [GitHub Pages deployment](https://shivram.ml/notes) or by building it yourself.

### Building the app
1. Clone the repo by running: `git clone https://github.com/shivrm/notes.git notes`

2. Navigate to the project directory using `cd notes`

3. Switch to a branch of your liking: 
	- `git checkout main` for the latest stable release.
	- `git checkout dev` for the development version.

4. Build the app using `npm run build`. The build files will be available in the `/public` folder.

5. Alternatively, use `npm run dev` to run the development server, useful for testing your own code.

## Usage

### Menu Buttons

The menu on the bottom-left corner (bottom-middle on vertical displays) contains two buttons:

 - The Theme button, indicated by either a `‚òÄ`Sun or a `üåï` Moon icon is used for changing the theme. Click on it to toggle the theme from dark mode to light, or vice versa.

 - The Add button, indicated by the `‚ûï`Plus icon is used for adding notes. Clicking on it will open the Note Editor

### Note Editor

The Note Editor has three points of interest: the main editor, as well as a font and color picker.

 - **The main editor** is in the shape of a note. It is focused by default when the editor is opened. The text you type in it will be displayed on the note

 - **The font picker** is located to the left of the main editor (top of the main editor on vertical displays). It contains five fonts to choose from. Clicking on a font will change the current font to it.

 - **The color picker** is located to the right of the main editor (bottom of the main editor on vertical displays). It contains seven colors to choose from. Clicking on a color will change the background color of the note.

 - **The Add/Edit Note** button is located at the bottom of the editor. When adding a note, clicking it will create a new note. When editing a note, clicking on it will cause the edits to be applied. This will always close the editor window.

 - **Closing the editor**: The editor can be closed either by clicking on the blank space around it, or by pressing the <kbd>Esc</kbd> Escape key.

### Notes

Each note has two buttons on top of it:

 - The **Edit** button, indicated by the `üìù`memo icon, is used to edit a note. When clicked, it opens the Note Editor.

 - The **Delete** button, indicated by the `üóë`wastebasket icon, is used to delete a note. Clicking it will immediately delete the note.
